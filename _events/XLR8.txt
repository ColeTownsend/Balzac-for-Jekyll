XLR8 was the first technical competition held in institute. I had no idea of what the competition would be about when I registered for it with my friends at the last moment.
After a few informative sessions, we became enthusiastic on thinking of  a design, and started speculating various possibilities, at a time when we did not even know the problem statement. The sessions seemed boring to us, but only to later realize that they were very useful. We ordered some of the equipments required. We started ACTUAL work on making the bot, a lot after the equipments arrived, when the competition was just a week away. We lost our unrealistic ideas and started thinking practically. Our primary aim became making a bot which just moves on a plane surface. We bought the components. But soon found the components defective. In the meanwhile, I and other team mates found one team mate particularly unhelpful and unwilling to make the bot. We got him replaced. All this greatly diminished the enthusiasm, but we gathered all the remaining enthusiasm and started making the bot. And Voila! We made the most stupid mistake ever and blew away the circuit, including a soldered PVC, which we had spent hours on to make. Our soldering was terrible. We soldered it again but could not find replacement for the burnt up IC. So we quitted!
I don't know why I used the word bot in the entire paragraph, because it never existed. We thought we will revive the bot in winter vacs, but in reality, what is dead may never REVIVE.
However, what does not kill one makes one stronger. Our failure only motivated to struggle harder and do better in the upcoming competitions. What I achieved in the following competitions might not have been possible without the technical touch I received from XLR8.
