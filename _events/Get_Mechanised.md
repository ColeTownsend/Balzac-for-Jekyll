Excited about gears and stuff? These sessions are just for you!
As the name suggests the main objective of the event is to give a basic idea about different mechanical aspects that must be looked upon while building a robot. The session starts building from the most fundamental and basic level for better understanding. You need no prerequisite to garner the maximum advantage of the sessions, all that matters is your will to learn new and amazing stuff.

## A Get Mechanised Experience

By - Anmol Gupta

It was truly an amazing session - practically the first one through which we realised that the high school mechanics that we learnt in class 11th for our JEE (:P) actually had some applications in real life and in an area which we all have had a lot of fascination since childhood - Robotics!
We were taught what all aspects to keep in mind while designing our (ro)bot like its dimensions, mass, the purpose, etc.
They told us about the various wheel configurations and the pros and cons of each of them, which was to prove helpful in deciding the best one based on the topography and friction. Next came the description about various mechanisms that enable the bots to move and turn.
Then came one of the most important parts involved in the movement of our bots - the motors. A number of types of motors - like Servo Motors, BO motors and DC Motors - were depicted to us practically.
For the base of the bots, there was a discussion on ‘Chassis’ and the material that could be used for the same viz, Acrylic, Aluminium and wood.
Finally at the end of the session we were told about the numerous types of battery and their advantages as well as disadvantages and which ones could prove to be useful in certain projects.

So, overall, it was a pretty good session - giving a good amount of feel about the mechanical aspect of robots and small bots, and it involves not just the movement of bot from one place to another, but also the locomotion and constrained movements!
