Starting this year onwards we introduce you to __"Informal Hangouts"__ , an extension of <em>"How Things Work"</em>, aimed at strengthening the community of Robotics Enthusiasts in IIT-Bombay.  
These informal events will be conducted on regular intervals and will be of various types.  


The various kinds of informal hangouts the club aims to conduct are :

**Group Discussions (GD)**

The topics will vary from quirky topics like "Feasibility of Iron Man's Suit" to extremely broad and complicated ones like "Deep Learning/Machine Learning".

**Talks**

Talks by knowledgeable people on topics like "SLAM" and "Robotics in Industries" aim to provide a more sophisticated perspective on these fields. 

**Hands-On Session**

"Theory shows you the path, Hands-On takes you on it."    
Interesting Hands-On sessions (e.g on 3D printing) will ensure you never lose touch.

**Lab Visits**

Aimed at keeping you acquainted with the research happening in the areas you love in the very place you live.
