## About the event

Make your XLR8 bot obedient enough to follow the path drawn for it! 
On a serious note, the Line Follower Competition is the best platform for freshmen to start off with AVR! It also uses the PID Algorithm. Big words, I know, but we'll be helping you out with the concepts before you get down to making your bot! So, chill, and take a look as to what the competition has in store for you!


## A Line Follower experience shared with us :-
__Line Follower : Possible in first year?__  

By - Rishabh Shah


Freshman year is the year of enthusiasm. Students want to try everything offered to them to get to know their interests and explore stuff. One such event was of making a Line Follower Bot. As soon as you hear this name you don't think it is actually possible in 1st year. It is really a challenging task at this stage.

Our task was to complete the bot in 4 days. For this we were taught the beautiful concept of AVR microcontrollers. It is through this information on how to convert analog input signals received from sensors to analog output signals according to a computer program, that made the building of this bot possible. Now this was just the electronic and maybe the mechanical part of it, but the challenge still remained on what to code and how to generate an analog output by a computer program.

Few important concepts used regarding this were ADC of AVR and Pulse Width Modulation. ADC was used to convert analog input to digital input(used later in code). Pulse Width Modulation enabled to convert digital output generated by our computer program to analog output received by our motors.

Coming to the coding part we used the information on thickness of the line we are to follow to build up 5 IR LED-photodiode sensors. Then we used the proportionality algorithm to give output to the bot according to various test cases that can be generated.

Finally after our line follower was completed and was working it was a sensation of immense happiness and satisfaction.
