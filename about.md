I am a software engineer with 10+ years experience in **Python**, with the latest 5 spent doing
**cloud development** on the Google Cloud Platform stack. Passionate about (big|fast) data, i am now using  **Elixir** with lots of fun (what a language!), and in the meanwhile **Go** made its appearance on my path, becoming the next thing.
