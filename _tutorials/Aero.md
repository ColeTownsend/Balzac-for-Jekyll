Aerodynamics is the science that studies objects moving through air. It is closely related

to fluid dynamics as air is considered a compressible fluid. Nowadays, aerodynamics is

the utmost important factor in Formula One car performance. It has even nearly become

one of the only aspects of performance gain due to the very marginal gains that can

currently be made by engine changes or other mechanical component development.

This downforce can be likened to a virtual increase in weight, pressing the car down

onto the road and increasing the available frictional force between the car and the road,

therefore enabling higher cornering speeds.

Furthermore, as Formula

One teams have the greatest

resources to develop aero

efficiency of its cars, the

greatest strives are made

here. F1 teams have

unrivalled CFD computing

power and at least one full

time wind tunnel only for

validating and improving their

designs.

While basic aerodynamic methods and formulas can be simply resolved, other

properties are verifiable with empirical formulas. More complex shapes such as

airplanes or racing cars are however impossible to calculate precisely, rendering

computational fluid dynamic systems (CFD applications on super computers) and wind

tunnels an absolute requirement to validate designs.
