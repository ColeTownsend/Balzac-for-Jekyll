## Introduction
XLR8 is the the first Technical Competition of the Academic year held by Robotics Club in IIT Bombay. <br>
The primary task is to build a manually controlled bot capable of negotiating different kinds of obstacles in its path in stipulated amount of time.<br>
The team which completes the task in minimum amount of time wins. <br>
There are also prizes for other aspects of the competition which are be declared during the XLR8 orientation.

<p><strong> DISCLAIMER :</strong><em> Don't get intimidated by seeing these components. We'll have sessions arranged before the competition to guide you through every step of the competition.
<strong> Mentors </strong>  will also be allotted to help and guide you.</em></p>
