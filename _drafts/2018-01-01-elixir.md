In the last period Elixir is becoming a very interesting and used language, for several reasons: performance, the functional paradigm (that has some uncontestable advantages), good and clear syntax. I am always been passionated about data processing, and so i decided to mix the two things up and come out with a project to learn the language.

## The context

I need data. Possibly a _not-so-boring_ (c) type of data. I will choose the market data from Eve Online.

### What is Eve Online

Eve Online is a sci-fi mmorpg, which has a very nice peculiarity: it's a sandbox almost totally user driven. This means that every advanced item in the universe is created (crafted, someone would say) by the players by acquiring prime materials and setting up more or less advanced production jobs. Clearly, most of these goods are not only used personally but sold on a market. This kind of mechanism generated a very complex economy, with inflation/deflation cycles, emotional fluctuations in item prices, and everything. The missing bit is that Eve Online is one of those games that lilterally gives you total READ capabilities via API.

In Eve Online you can choose whatever career you want: being a pure military, a scientist, a trader. This very last is always been the part that interested me (and, a well known say in Eve Online states that the most aggressive type of fight in the game is represented by market pvp - player versus player).

So, from the point of view of a trader, data is everything. The game universe can be represented by a graph of 22.000 systems, with each system containing several planets and each of them being able to have one _associated_ station orbiting around it. And stations can have multiple services, _market_ included.

## The problem

What would be ideal to have, for a market mogul ? Well, simply told, a tool that would take few systems in input, check all the items available on the market, and analyze all the possible buy/sell permutations on all the systems to see where a profit can be made. And this is only the easiest thing to do.

## The solution

## What am i going to develop

## Scalability
