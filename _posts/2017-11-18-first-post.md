Here is an informal, but intuitive proof that I came up with back in highschool.

The trick is to take your calculator and enter: 

1/9 = 0.1111...

Then,

2/9 = 0.2222...

3/9 = 0.3333...

8/9 = 0.8888...

We're beginning to see a pattern here.

So,

9/9 must be 0.9999...

But, 9/9 = 1 

Hence, 0.9999... = 1

And we're done!
