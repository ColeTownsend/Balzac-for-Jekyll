## Introduction

As a high school student, mathematics was the subject I struggled the most with. However, I was rather intrigued by the mysteries surrounding math and though I had no idea what most of the symbols were, I enjoyed playing around with my calculator while there was nothing better to do in class. 

I first came across the idea that 0.999... = 1 (where the 9's are repeating infinitely many times, of course) whilst studying [Geometric Series](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeometricSeries.html) and I must say, even after seeing the proof, I was not fully convinced. This may be due to my lack of understanding of what "infinitely many" really meant. At the time, I needed something tangible that I could grasp. 

## Informal Proof

The basic intuition I had was to use the fact that 1 is a rational number and so is 0.999..., since they are equal, then I must be able to express 0.999... as a ratio of two integers which are equal to 1. This is very easy since the ratio of any integer $$a \ne 0$$ with itself is equal to 1. That is, 

$${a \over a} = 1, a \ne 0, a \in \mathbb{Z}$$.

For example, $${1 \over 1} = 1$$.

Now, after spending some time playing around with the numbers on my calculator, I discovered the following pattern.

$${1 \over 9} = 0.111...$$

$${2 \over 9} = 0.222...$$

$${3 \over 9} = {1 \over 3} = 0.333...$$

$${4 \over 9} = 0.444...$$

$${5 \over 9} = 0.555...$$

$${6 \over 9} = {2 \over 3} = 0.666...$$

$${7 \over 9} = 0.777...$$

$${8 \over 9} = 0.888...$$

Here I thought it was reasonable to assume by induction that,
$${9 \over 9} = 1 = 0.999...$$.
