Line follower is an autonomous robot that follows a line, either a black line on white surface or vise-versa. Robot must be able to detect particular line and keep following it.

For special situations such as cross overs where robot can have more than one path which can be followed, predefined path must be followed by the robot.

The main electronics/mechanical components that will be used in making this line follower robot are IR sensors, motor-drivers and microcontroller.
